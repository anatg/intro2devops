Let's tell a story

Who here has a website from their workplace or school?

Let's take a look at it.

Now what is some of the infrastructure necessary for your work/school to make that page available to the Internet? - Whiteboard it....

Basic infrastructure concepts
- DNS
- network peering and routing
- physical / virtual servers
- services:  httpd/databases
- files & directory and users and tools
- dev and test environments
- high availability and DR
- developer workstations

How much of this do you need to know?
- It depends?


Analogize start-up infrastructure to automobile needs
- Who here has ever ridden in a car?
- Who here has ever called Uber or a Taxi?
- Who knows how to drive?
- Who owns or has ever owned a car?
- Who knows here has ever change the oil in their car?
- Perform basic repairs?
- Build a car and design it?

The more you know you more about cars probably maps to your needs for that infrastructure.

Scaling similarly
- low traffic: Uber & Taxis & CarShare
- modest traffic: Car Lease - Small businesses
- high traffic: Buy a car, outsource maintenance - Many business
  - then do your own maintenance - Universities / Govt deptartments
- web scale: Custom build a fleet of cars and hire an army of mechanics - UPS

Automation and Standardization
- IT is where the auto industry was in the first decade of the 20th century
  - but worse
- Suppose you get in a car and every control was different
  - levers vs. tracked vehicles vs. steam engine vs. l/r side of road ...

So how do we automate building our computers?

Let's look at the downsides of GUIs

and compare to automating around the idea of 'resources'
